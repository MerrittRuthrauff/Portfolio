# What's the Dealio Chat Application & Server

## Client and Server both written in Python 3; client uses tkinter GUI implementation (i.e. #sudo apt install python3-tk)

**Usage**
## Mac/Linux: python3 <filename>.py
## PC: python <filename>.py or by opening file via Python 
*(note Windows 10 WSL users may need to follow SSH steps to run tkinter)*

**NOTE**
## This is only a partial implementation of the WTDP.  May not work with other servers/clients until complete.
## assumes well-behaved clients.
