This repo contains 5 programming assignmentss that I completed at Westminster and am proud of.

This assignment was done as for the final project of the Programming Languages class. In this class we focused on learning about and mastering functional programming languages. For our final, we were asked to work with a partner write a program in ELm, a langague that nobody in the class had experience with. This assignment demonstrates my project based work in a pair setting, as well as my proficiency in more than one programming language.
