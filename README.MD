**Senior portfolio**

This repo contains 5 programming assignmentss that I completed at Westminster College and am proud of.

# 4pong
This assignment was done as for the final project of the Programming Languages class. In this class we focused on learning about and mastering functional programming languages. For our final, we were asked to work with a partner write a program in ELm, a langague that nobody in the class had experience with. This assignment demonstrates my project based work in a pair setting, as well as my knowledge of concepts of software design.

# Dealio Chat Application
This assignment was the final project of the Computer Networks class. It consists of a multithreaded server, and chatroom client. This assignemnt forced me to learn how to write and use GUI's, and helped better my knowledge of how a protocol influences a network application. In this class I learned how programs interact with the network, and hardware. This assignment also demonstrates my ability to work as a pair, and my systems level knowledge of the computer.

# Flags300
 This assignment was done as the final project for the Data Mining class. For this assignment, we were asked to form a group, pick a dataset, and solve a problem with it. We chose a dataset from the 1980's containing information about most countries flags. We decided to guess the religion of a given country based on aspects of their flag. This assignment demonstrates my ability to work in a group, and shows my effective problem solving skills.
 
 # HAMATH
 This project was done for the Software Engineering class. I worked in a group of four for the entire semster. This project helped be gain experience working in a group setting, learn the techniques of software design, and helped develop my skills in multiple programming languages. For this project, I worked on the front end doing some design, and on the back end implementing core features such as email integration. 
 
 # Java Threads
 This assignment was done for the Operating Systems class. We were tasked to implement a multithreaded application that generates the Collatz sequence using child and parent threads. This lab helped me better my understanding of how software interacts with hardware, specifically how threads work. This is a core concept in computing, and I found this assignment to demonstrate that concept well. This assignment demonstrates my systems level knowledge of computing, as well as effective problem solving skills.

# [FishFinder](https://github.com/MerrittRuthrauff/FishFinder)
This is my senior project. It demonstrates significant experience working individually. Depsite having to restart my project a week before the due date, I still believe that this demonstrates problem solving skills, software design skills, and determination.
